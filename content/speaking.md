As much as I love to write code, I enjoy teaching even more. That's part of the reason I started a blog. I feel like I have to struggle to learn new things and if I can help make that struggle better for other people, than I think I've done something good. If you are interested in having me speak at your conference or organization, just <a href="http://www.raymondcamden.com/contact-me">drop me a line</a> and I'll get back to you as soon as I can.
