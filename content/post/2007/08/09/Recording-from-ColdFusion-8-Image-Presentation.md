Unfortunately my machine froze right at the beginning of Q and A, but there were questions earlier on in the presentation. You can download the slides and code using the Download link below. Note that the file size is a bit big (8.something megs).<p><a href='enclosures/D%3A%5Chosts%5Cwww%2Ecoldfusionjedi%2Ecom%5Cenclosures%2FArchive%202%2Ezip'>Download attached file.</a></p>
