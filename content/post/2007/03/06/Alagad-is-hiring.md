Alagad, the company that produces the nice Alagad Image.cfc, is <a href="http://doughughes.net/index.cfm?event=viewEntry&entryId=222">hiring</a>. Looks like a pretty good set of benefits as well. I know Doug Hughes (the guy who runs Alagad) and he is a good guy, so this may be a great opportunity for someone.
