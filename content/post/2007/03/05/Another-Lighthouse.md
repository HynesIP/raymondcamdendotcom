Looks like someone else thinks <a href="http://lighthousepro.riaforge.org">Lighthouse</a> is a cool name for a bug tracker:

<a href="http://www.lighthouseapp.com/">http://www.lighthouseapp.com/</a>

I've had a few people mention this to me already so I thought I'd let folks know I am aware of it. I'm not quite sure what to think. What do people think I should do?
