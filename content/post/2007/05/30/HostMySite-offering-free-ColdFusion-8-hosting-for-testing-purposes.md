HostMySite is offering <a href="http://www.hostmysite.com/CF8/">free ColdFusion 8</a> hosting for people who want to play with ColdFusion. This isn't for web site hosting per se, but if you don't want to download or setup ColdFusion 8 locally, or if you want to share some cool demos with others, this is definitely a nice alternative.
