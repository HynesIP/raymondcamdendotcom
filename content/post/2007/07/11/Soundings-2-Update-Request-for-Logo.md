A few days ago I <a href="http://www.raymondcamden.com/index.cfm/2007/7/6/Soundings-2-Preview-Release">released</a> a preview update for Soundings 2. This update focused on new pagination features for surveys. Today I'm releasing an update with the following changes:

<ul>
<li>Updated handlers for Text Box questions. They now support pagination.
<li>Reports can now be generated in PDF.
<li>Reports can now have a question filter applied. This is useful for cases where your report may have a bunch of questions about the responder that aren't really relevant to the report itself.
</ul>

As mentioned in the last entry, Soundings really needs a bit of UI loving, so if someone wants to help clean up the HTML a bit, please let me know.

I'm also looking for a Soundings logo, something on par with the BlogCFC logo. I can't offer much in the way of money (ok, I can't offer any money), but think of the fame you will get!

As a side note - I forgot to mention. Soundings now makes use of Spry. The question filter for reporting is AJAX based. It isn't a terribly sexy use of AJAX, but it works.<p><a href='enclosures/D%3A%5Chosts%5Cwww%2Ecoldfusionjedi%2Ecom%5Cenclosures%2Fsoundings1%2Ezip'>Download attached file.</a></p>
