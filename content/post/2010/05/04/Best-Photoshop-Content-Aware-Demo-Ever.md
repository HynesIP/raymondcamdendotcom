Take one broken image:

<img src="http://www.raymondcamden.com/images/test2.jpg" title="You should know why this image is broken." />

And then fix it in Photoshop CS5:

<img src="http://www.coldfusionjedi.com/images/test2a.jpg" title="Next up - the Ewoks." />

Problem solved. May the Fourth be with you.

p.s. Ok, just to make it clear, I'm a complete and utter Photoshop noob. This could have been done <i>much</i> cleaner. But considering the fact that I did this in 5 minutes as a newbie - I think it says a lot. :)
