Today is the last day to <a href="http://callforspeakers.cfconf.org/?event=vote&eventId=188">vote for the topics</a> you want to see at CFUNITED. I've proposed a grand total of one topic this year (last year I had 4 - want to take it a bit easier this time!) - AIR development with jQuery and ColdFusion.
