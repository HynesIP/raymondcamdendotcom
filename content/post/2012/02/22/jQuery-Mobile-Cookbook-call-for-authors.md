Love jQuery Mobile? Want to be part of a new book? Then please consider helping out the new <a href="http://jquerymobilecookbook.com/">jQuery Mobile Cookbook</a>. There's lots of cool people involved (including myself ;) as well as a big group of volunteers ready to write entries. Join the fun! Big thanks to <a href="http://appendto.com/">appendTo</a> for spearheading this effort!
