Thank you to everyone who attended my breakout session at the jQuery Conference today. For those who did not, I realize these slides and code probably make little sense out of context. I'll be giving an extended version of this deck (with mobile topics added) in Nashville soon and in San Francisco in a few weeks. (Details on those speaking engagements as they get closer.) After that I'll give the talk on Connect for anyone and everyone.<p><a href='enclosures/C%3A%5Chosts%5C2012%2Eraymondcamden%2Ecom%5Cenclosures%2FArchive25%2Ezip'>Download attached file.</a></p>
