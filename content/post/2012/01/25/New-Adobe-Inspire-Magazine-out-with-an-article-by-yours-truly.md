The title says it all. The latest issue of Adobe's <a href="http://www.adobe.com/newsletters/inspire/february2012/index.html">Inspire Magazine</a> is out. There's lots of good content with the only low point being my own article (grin) on PhoneGap: <a href="http://www.adobe.com/newsletters/inspire/february2012/articles/article5/index.html">Combining your web skills with PhoneGap to build mobile apps</a>. Probably nothing new for folks who read my blog entries here.
