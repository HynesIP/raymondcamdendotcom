For those of you at the mobile workshop in San Francisco today (or anyone, really), I've attached the PDF and code samples to this blog entry. Once the recording is posted, I'll add a comment below with that URL. 

If you want another version of it - I'll point out my <a href="http://www.udemy.com/introduction-to-jquery-mobile/">course</a> at Udemy as another option.

If you attended my presentation today and have feedback, please leave me a comment, or use my contact form.<p><a href='enclosures/C%3A%5Chosts%5C2012%2Eraymondcamden%2Ecom%5Cenclosures%2Fintro%20to%20jquery%20mobile1%2Ezip'>Download attached file.</a></p>
