It's a week of really great mobile-related releases. Earlier we had <a href="http://www.phonegap.com">PhoneGap</a> hit 1.6, and today we have <a href="http://www.jquerymobile.com">jQuery Mobile</a> hit 1.1.0. Full release notes on the changes may be found here: <a href="http://jquerymobile.com/blog/2012/04/13/announcing-jquery-mobile-1-1-0/">Announcing jQuery Mobile 1.1.0</a>. If you haven't looked at jQuery Mobile in a while, I highly encourage you to take a look at it. The performance issues you may have seen in the past (especially on Android) seem to be licked quite thoroughly and overall the project feels incredibly solid now.
