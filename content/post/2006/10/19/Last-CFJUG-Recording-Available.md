This time I didn't screw up! You can watch the recording of my repeat presentation on security at this URL:

<a href="http://adobechats.adobe.acrobat.com/p14319489/">http://adobechats.adobe.acrobat.com/p14319489/</a>

As I said before - most of my readers won't need to watch this presentation - but heck - if you are bored, be my guest.
