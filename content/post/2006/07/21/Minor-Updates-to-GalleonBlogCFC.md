I've made two small updates today. First, I fixed the database scripts in <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/projects/galleon">Galleon</a>. If you last upgrade went ok, then you need not worry about getting this version.

Secondly I made another small update to <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/projects/blogcfc">BlogCFC</a>. This include a minor new feature and a few small fixes. More details may be found <a href="http://www.blogcfc.com/index.cfm/2006/7/21/BlogCFC-51003-Released">here</a>.
