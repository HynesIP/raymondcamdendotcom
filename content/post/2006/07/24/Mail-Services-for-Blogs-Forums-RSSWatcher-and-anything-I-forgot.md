Anyone subscribed to this blog, or <a href="http://www.brooks-bilson.com/blogs/rob/">Rob's</a>, or perhaps is a user of <a href="http://www.rsswatcher.com">RSSWatcher</a>, will notice that they are no longer getting emails. I've had to shut down my mail server (see previous entry) and this is one of the side effects. Sorry folks!
