At the Spry session at CFUNITED I talked about some code I used for my various Spry demos. This code converted queries to XML objects to use for Spry. (By the way, I'm working on some code that may make it even easier to use CFCs - no more converting to XML!) I just cleaned up my demo code a bit and cleaned it up in a nice CFC. The CFC has a listToXML, arrayToXML, queryToXML, and structToXML.
