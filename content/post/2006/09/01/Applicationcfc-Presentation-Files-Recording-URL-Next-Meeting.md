Sorry for the delay on this folks, but here is the URL for my Application.cfc presentation. I was delayed as I was waiting to see if this was the <b>official</b> URL. There is a chance this URL may change though. 

<a href="http://adobechats.adobe.breezecentral.com/p73045503/">http://adobechats.adobe.breezecentral.com/p73045503/</a>

I am tentatively scheduling a meeting for the end of this month, the last Wednesday. I can cover one of two topics. Please let me know what you think - and whatever I don't cover in September will be covered later.

1) How to add security to a web site. This is a class for beginners and covers the basic, "How in the heck do I start" type situation. It will cover creating a username/password table and how to add a simple logon form. I will talk about basic authentication and if we have time, authorization for more advanced security needs.

2) Custom Tags: What are they, and are they planning to attack! You get the idea.

Lastly - someone give me a good name for this group.<p><a href='enclosures/D%3A%5Cwebsites%5Cdev%2Ecamdenfamily%2Ecom%5Cenclosures%2Fappcfc%2Ezip'>Download attached file.</a></p>
