This morning I released a small update to <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/projects/harlan">Harlan ColdFusion Ad Server</a>. Changes are as follows:

<ul>
<li>The MySQL db install file had many bugs. These are fixed now.
<li>All db install files updated to support new target feature.
<li>Application.cfc error email said Lighthouse Pro, not Harlan
<li>Small HTML error in campaign editor.
<li>Finally, a new feature. Ads can now have a target. This allows you to set up ads that, when clicked, will open up in a new window. Of it your site is framed, you can make the ad load and get rid of the frames.
</ul>

As always, you can download the application from the <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/projects/harlan">project page</a>.
