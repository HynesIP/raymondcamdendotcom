<img src="http://www.raymondcamden.com/images/cfjedi//shocked.png" align="left" style="margin-right:5px;margin-bottom:5px"> I was shocked - and pleased - by the large group of people who turned out for my presentation today. Charlie has posted the recording URL: <a href="http://experts.na3.acrobat.com/p65969256/">http://experts.na3.acrobat.com/p65969256/</a>. You can download the files below as well as a PDF export of the presentation. (Actually, I always use PDFs for presentations. I find it a bit quicker when alt-tabbing between slides and code.) Anyway, thank you to everyone (all 100+ of you!) for turning out. I hope you enjoyed it and learned something as well. I'm thinking my next presentation will focus specifically on jQuery and ColdFusion. Most folks know I'm something of a jQuery fan-boy now, but it <i>did</i> take me a while to get over a few initial humps, so I'd like to perhaps present on jQuery and help people pick up the framework quicker.<p><a href='enclosures/D%3A%5Chosts%5Cwww%2Ecoldfusionjedi%2Ecom%5Cenclosures%2Fajaxcfpreso%2Ezip'>Download attached file.</a></p>
