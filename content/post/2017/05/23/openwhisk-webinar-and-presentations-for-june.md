In June, I'll be giving two presentations on Apache OpenWhisk. The first will be online (and free) on June 7 at 12PM CST. You can register for the event here: https://engage.vevent.com/index.jsp?eid=556&seid=90389

And if by some chance you happen to be in the great state of Louisiana and want to see me give the talk live, I'll be giving the presentation to the Acadiana Software Group on June 14 at 6:30 PM. I'll try to bring some schwag for that one. Here's a Facebook event link if that's your thing: https://www.facebook.com/events/1920692501553535/?acontext=%7B%22ref%22%3A%224%22%2C%22action_history%22%3A%22null%22%7D
