Two small fixes to the blog 3 beta... 

1) Fixes to editing entries with &lt;more/&gt; being used.

2) Couldn't assign an entry to N categories.

The zip can be found <a href="http://www.camdenfamily.com/morpheus/blog/blog3beta.zip">here</a>. This release has NOT been heavily tested, so be careful.
