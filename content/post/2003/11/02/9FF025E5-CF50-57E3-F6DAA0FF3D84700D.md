In a former life, I was a Spectra developer, and did engineering work for the project. I also helped setup and design the community source site for the Spectra code base. I'm no longer involved with Spectra anymore, but I'd thought I'd pass on the word that <a href="http://spectrasource.macromedia.com">version 1.5.3</a> was released last Friday.
