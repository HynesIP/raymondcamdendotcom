<p>
Just a quick note that an article I wrote for DZone, <a href="http://css.dzone.com/articles/overview-mobile-debugging">An Overview of Mobile Debugging Techniques – Part One</a>, is now live. I wrote this a few months ago but it finally went live today. I'll be doing a followup later this month.
