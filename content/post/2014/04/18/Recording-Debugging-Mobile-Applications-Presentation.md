<p>
Thank you to everyone who attended (not sure how many - 20+ I think?) my Google Hangout presentation today. I <i>think</i> I'm getting used to the platform but as always, if anyone has any tips for how I could do these better, I'll gladly listen to your advice. You can watch the recording below. I'm not attaching the slide deck as there aren't any 'real' demo files for you to play with, but if anyone really wants it, I will.
