In two weeks I'll be speaking at [FluentConf](http://conferences.oreilly.com/fluent/javascript-html-us) in sunny, warm San Francisco. I hope to see you there (and I'l be brining some books to give away) as this will be my first public speaking
engagement on the awesomeness of [StrongLoop](http://www.strongloop.com). Of course, outside of me there are some 
*incredibly* talented people speaking there who will absolutely blow your mind. Fluent is one of those conferences where
I'd pay to attend if I wasn't speaking.

So - how about you - do you want to attend? I've got two options for you. Don't tell anyone else though - this is between
just you and I...

![A Secret](http://static.raymondcamden.com/images/2016/02/catsecret.jpg)

First - I have a discount code for 20% off the main ticket price. That secret code is `CAMDEN20`.

Second - I have a free [Exhibit Hall plus pass](http://conferences.oreilly.com/fluent/javascript-html-us/public/content/exhibit-hall-plus) to give away - a $99 value. While this isn't a *full* conference pass, it does give you some good options. I'd like to offer this to anyone who is freelancing, learning, or generally can't afford a pass and would make good use of it. Just drop me a line. (See the comments below. If someone gets this pass, I'll post a comment to let folks know it isn't available.)
