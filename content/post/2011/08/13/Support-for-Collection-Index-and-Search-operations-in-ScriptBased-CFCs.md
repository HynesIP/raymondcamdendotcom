Attached to this blog entry you will find support for adding Solr support to your script based CFCs. These CFCs act like the other tag wrappers in ColdFusion 9 and should be saved to your &lt;cfintall&gt;/customtags/com/adobe/coldfusion folder. <b>Please back up your base.cfc file first!</b> The other files are new. Here's an example of how your code may look.

<p/>

<code>
&lt;cfscript&gt;
c = new com.adobe.coldfusion.collection();
c.create(collection="test2",path=server.coldfusion.rootdir & "/collections");

idx = new com.adobe.coldfusion.index();
//q is a query I made earlier
r = idx.refresh(collection="test2",key="id",body="body",query=q,status=true);
writeDump(var=r,label="refresh");

mysearch = new com.adobe.coldfusion.search();
res = mysearch.search(criteria="cfabort",collection="cfdocs",maxrows=5,status="true");
&lt;/cfscript&gt;
</code>

This code has been submitted to the CF engineering team for a future update, but it had not yet been heavily QAed. Use with caution.<p><a href='enclosures/C%3A%5Chosts%5C2009%2Ecoldfusionjedi%2Ecom%5Cenclosures%2Fforblog1%2Ezip'>Download attached file.</a></p>
