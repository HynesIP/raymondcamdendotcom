Yesterday I gave a presentation on PhoneGap. In that presentation I had a few samples that I'd like to share. This isn't anything too exciting, and doesn't cover as much as <a href="https://github.com/cfjedimaster/PhoneGapMega">"Mega"</a> project, but if you are looking for some small samples to play with, these may be of use. The examples cover:

<ul>
<li>Camera
<li>Compass
<li>Contact Search
<li>General Device (shows basic device+connection info)
<li>Geolocation (also makes use of Google Static Maps)
<li>jQuery Mobile (super basic, mainly just shows how it looks)
</ul>

All the projects may be found in the zip attached to this entry. Does it make sense for me to put these in Github?<p><a href='enclosures/C%3A%5Chosts%5C2009%2Ecoldfusionjedi%2Ecom%5Cenclosures%2Fpgdemos%2Ezip'>Download attached file.</a></p>
