If you are in the Bay Area you can sign up for a free workshop on building Nook apps using Adobe AIR. I've done this myself and have an app in the queue to be reviewed. Once approved I'll blog about what it was like. (Painless - but I'll talk about the process and the reports.) Anyway, if you are interested, you can sign up here:
