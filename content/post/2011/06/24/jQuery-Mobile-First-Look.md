Just a quick note to let folks know that <a href="http://www.packtpub.com/jquery-mobile-first-look/book">jQuery Mobile First Look</a> was released by Packt Publishing today. Obviously it's written for a non-final version of jQuery Mobile, but it's worthwhile reading if you want an early introduction to the framework. Disclaimer: I worked on the book as a TE for it.
