My botched preso from a few weeks ago to the Connecticut CFUG will be redone tonight. I've already tested the connection and know how to get around the 'your res is too sexy for connect' bug so things <i>should</i> run smoothly. The meeting will be held at 5PM CST. It is a repeat of my CFUNITED CF8 Ajax presentation, so some of my readers have probably seen this before. I'm going to try to fit in more material from the second part that I created just for CFUNITED however. 

The Connect address is: <a href="http://adobechats.adobe.acrobat.com/cfugitives/">http://adobechats.adobe.acrobat.com/cfugitives/</a>

The meeting is open to anyone left handed or born during a new moon that fell on a Monday.
