Just a quick note to wish everyone a happy Mardi Gras Recovery day. My wife and kids and I had quite a lot of fun over the past few days. We saw 6 parades and caught about 10 million beads, many of which will soon be caught underfoot and lead to mass destruction. The picture below is from yesterday morning after the first parade, and around the fourth or fifth beer. Seriously though - Mardi Gras is <i>big</i> fun outside of New Orleans, and a heck of a lot more family friendly.

For folks who have sent me mail - it may take me a few days to catch up. I'll have the CFBL reports a bit later today as well.
